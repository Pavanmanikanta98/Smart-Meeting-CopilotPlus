Your mission is to transcend the surface-level details of the provided meeting minutes and distill them into high-level, actionable, strategic insights for executive review. You must uncover the 'why' behind the 'what'.\n",

    "    Your goal in this phase is to post the main meeting summary and insights to the primary company channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  **Find Main Channel**: Use `slack_list_channels` to find the single most appropriate public channel for company-wide announcements. Look for names like 'general', 'announcements', or 'all-abc'. Remember this channel's ID.\n",

    "    3.  **Iterate Through Checklist**: For each action item, perform the following steps:\n",
    "        a. **Determine Target Channel**:\n",
    "            - First, check if the action item `owner` (e.g., \"AI team\") exactly matches a channel name you found earlier (e.g., 'ai-team').\n",
    "            - If it's a direct match, use that specific channel's ID.\n",
    "            - If there is no matching channel, default to using the main channel ID from Phase 1.\n",
    "        b. **Find User to Mention**: Use `slack_find_user_by_name` to get the user ID for the action item's `owner`.\n",
    "        c. **Format Mention**:\n",
    "            - If a user ID is found, format it for Slack mentioning (e.g., `<@USER_ID>`).\n",
    "            - If no user is found or the owner is a team name, format the name in bold (e.g., `*AI team*`).\n",
    "        d. **Post Notification**: Use `slack_post_message` to send the notification for this single action item to the target channel determined in step 3a.\n",
    "        e. **Review and Repeat**: After posting, mentally check off the item. If there are more action items left in the initial list, you MUST immediately repeat steps 3a-3d for the next item. DO NOT stop and give a final answer yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # CRITICAL RULES\n",
    "    - **Complete the Checklist**: You must process ALL action items before providing a final summary of your work.\n",
    "    - **Tool Parameter Integrity**: `channel_id` MUST be a channel ID (starts with 'C').\n",

    "    # Your goal in this phase is to post the main meeting summary and insights to the primary company channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # 1.  **Find Main Channel**: Use the `slack_list_channels` tool to find the single most appropriate public channel for company-wide announcements. Look for names like 'general', 'announcements', or 'all-abc'.\n",
    "    # 2.  **Post Main Content**: Use `slack_post_message` to post the formatted \"Final Summary\" and \"Final Insights\" to the channel ID you discovered in the previous step.\n",

    "    # ---\n",
    "    # # PHASE 2: Action Item Notification\n",
    "    # After Phase 1 is complete, your goal is to notify the owners of their specific action items.\n",

    "    # 3.  **Process EACH Action Item**: For every action item in the provided list, perform the following sub-steps:\n",
    "    #     a. **Find User**: Use `slack_find_user_by_name` to find the user ID for the action item's `owner`.\n",
    "    #     b. **Format Mention**:\n",
    "    #         - If a user ID is found, format it for Slack mentioning (e.g., `<@USER_ID>`).\n",
    "    #         - If no user is found or the owner is a team, format the name in bold (e.g., `*AI team*`).\n",
    "    #     c. **Post Notification**: Use `slack_post_message` to send a message containing the specific `Task` and `Deadline` to the **main channel** you found in Phase 1. Include the formatted mention from the previous sub-step.\n",

    "    # # CRITICAL RULES\n",
    "    # - **Phased Execution**: You MUST successfully complete Phase 1 before starting Phase 2.\n",
