    "        a. **Determine Target Channel**:\n",
    "            - First, check if the action item `owner` (e.g., \"AI team\") exactly matches a channel name you found earlier (e.g., 'ai-team').\n",
    "            - If it's a direct match, use that specific channel's ID.\n",
    "            - If there is no matching channel, default to using the main channel ID from Phase 1.\n",
    "        b. **Find User to Mention**: Use `slack_find_user_by_name` to get the user ID for the action item's `owner`.\n",
    "        c. **Format Mention**:\n",
    "            - If a user ID is found, format it for Slack mentioning (e.g., `<@USER_ID>`).\n",
    "            - If no user is found or the owner is a team name, format the name in bold (e.g., `*AI team*`).\n",
    "        d. **Post Notification**: Use `slack_post_message` to send the notification for this single action item to the target channel determined in step 3a.\n",
    "        e. **Review and Repeat**: After posting, mentally check off the item. If there are more action items left in the initial list, you MUST immediately repeat steps 3a-3d for the next item. DO NOT stop and give a final answer yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # CRITICAL RULES\n",
    "    - **Complete the Checklist**: You must process ALL action items before providing a final summary of your work.\n",
    "    - **Tool Parameter Integrity**: `channel_id` MUST be a channel ID (starts with 'C').\n",
    "    - **Error Handling**: If a user is not found, format their name in bold and proceed. Do not stop.\n",
