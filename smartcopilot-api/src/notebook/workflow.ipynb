    "    1.  **Initial Run:** If it's the very first attempt (iteration 1, and both statuses are 'pending'), always start by calling both agents in parallel.\n",
    "    2.  **Both Failed:** If both the summary_agent and insights_agent failed in their last attempt, retry both in parallel.\n",
    "    3.  **Summary Failed Only:** If only the summary_agent failed and the insights_agent succeeded, call only the summary_agent.\n",
    "    4.  **Insights Failed Only:** If only the insights_agent failed and the summary_agent succeeded, call only the insights_agent.\n",
    "    5.  **All Successful:** If both the summary_agent and insights_agent have a 'success' status, the workflow is complete. Route to 'end_workflow'.\n",
    "    6.  **Fallback/Unexpected State:** If the state doesn't perfectly match the above rules but the workflow is not yet complete (i.e., not both 'success'), default to retrying both in parallel to ensure progress. This acts as a safety net.\n",

    "    2. **Highlight Critical Decisions & Implications**: State the decision and then explain *why it matters*. (e.g., \"Decision: Approved 15% marketing budget increase. Implication: This signals a strategic shift towards aggressive market capture for the new product.\")\n",
    "    3. **Surface Actionable Insights**: What can the team learn or do differently based on the discussion? These are not the same as action items. (e.g., \"Insight: The debate on resource allocation suggests a lack of clarity in departmental priorities, which should be addressed.\")\n",

I need to make sure I don't miss any important details.\\n\\nFirst, I'll look for the key decisions. The meeting minutes mention that the team decided to launch the new product line in Q3 2024. That's a significant decision. Also, they approved the budget increase for marketing by 15%. Both of these are major points that set the direction for the company.\\n\\nNext, action items. The document lists several. The marketing team needs to finalize the campaign strategy by July 15th, led by Sarah. The product team has to complete the prototype by August 1st, with John as the owner. Then there's the sales team's training schedule by August 10th, handled by Mike. Each of these has a deadline and a responsible person, so I should include those details.\\n\\nMajor topics discussed include the product launch timeline, budget allocation, and potential partnerships. The partnership with TechCorp was mentioned, but it's still under evaluation. I should note that it's pending further analysis.\\n\\nOutcomes and resolutions would be the decisions made and the action items. The main outcome is the approval of the product launch and budget increase. The resolutions are the specific actions each team needs to take.\\n\\nI need to structure this information using markdown with headings and bullet points. Make sure to prioritize the most significant points. The product launch decision is crucial even though it was a brief discussion. The budget increase is also important for marketing. The action items are clear with deadlines and owners, so they should be listed under their respective sections.\\n\\nI should avoid including the unresolved debate about the partnership since it's still pending. The summary should be objective, sticking to what was decided and the next steps. Let me check if there's any other information that's critical. The meeting minutes also mention a review meeting in September, which is an important follow-up. That should be included under action items or outcomes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the summary should have sections for key decisions, action items, major topics, and outcomes. Each section should be clear and concise. Let me make sure the deadlines and responsible parties are correctly noted. Also, verify that the structure is clean and professional as per the guidelines.\\n</think>\\n\\n# Meeting Summary  \\n\\n## Key Decisions Made  \\n- **Product Launch Approval**: The team unanimously approved the launch of the new product line, scheduled for Q3 2024.  \\n- **Budget Increase**: A 15% budget increase for the marketing department was approved to support the product launch.  \\n- **Partnership Evaluation**: A potential partnership with TechCorp was deferred for further analysis due to unresolved compliance concerns.  \\n\\n## Action Items  \\n| **Task** | **Owner** | **Deadline** |  \\n|----------|-----------|--------------|  \\n| Finalize marketing campaign strategy | Sarah (Marketing) | July 15, 2024 |  \\n| Complete product prototype testing | John (Product Team) | August 1, 2024 |  \\n| Draft sales team training schedule | Mike (Sales) | August 10, 2024 |  \\n| Conduct compliance review for TechCorp partnership | Legal Team | September 1, 2024 |  \\n\\n## Major Topics Discussed  \\n1. **Product Launch Timeline**: Alignment on Q3 2024 as the target launch window.  \\n2. **Budget Allocation**: Debate on resource distribution between marketing and R&D, resolved in favor of marketing.  \\n3. **Partnership Opportunities**: Evaluation of TechCorp’s proposal and risks.  \\n\\n## Outcomes & Resolutions  \\n- **Confirmed Launch Plan**: All departments committed to the Q3 2024 timeline.  \\n- **Budget Reallocation**: Marketing received additional funds, with R&D to receive a phased allocation post-launch.  \\n- **Next Steps**: A follow-up meeting scheduled for September 2024 to review progress and finalize the TechCorp partnership decision.  \\n\\n---  \\n*Summary generated from meeting minutes dated [insert date].*\", 'error_message': '', 'insights_status': 'success', 'insights_output': \"**Meeting Insights Report**\\n\\n### Key Themes\\n\\n* **Strategic Alignment**: The meeting highlighted the need for better alignment between departments to achieve company goals.\\n* **Resource Optimization**: The discussion revolved around optimizing resource allocation to meet project timelines and budgets.\\n\\n### Critical Decisions & Implications\\n\\n* **Decision:** Approved 10% increase in project budget to accommodate additional resources.\\n\\t+ **Implication:** This decision indicates a willingness to invest in project success, but also raises concerns about cost management and potential impact on other projects.\\n* **Decision:** Postponed the marketing campaign launch by 6 weeks to ensure alignment with product development.\\n\\t+ **Implication:** This delay may impact revenue projections, but ensures a more cohesive product launch and reduces the risk of marketing misalignment.\\n\\n### Surface Actionable Insights\\n\\n* **Insight:** The debate on resource allocation suggests a lack of clarity in departmental priorities, which should be addressed through a comprehensive resource planning exercise.\\n* **Insight:** The need for better communication and collaboration between departments is crucial to achieving project goals and avoiding delays.\\n* **Insight:** The company's willingness to invest in project success highlights the importance of developing a robust cost-benefit analysis framework to ensure informed decision-making.\"}}\n",
