The user wants a concise summary focusing on key decisions, action items, major topics, and outcomes. I need to make sure I don't miss any important details.\\n\\nFirst, I'll look for the key decisions. The meeting minutes mention that the team decided to launch the new product line in Q3 2024. That's a significant decision. Also, they approved the budget increase for marketing by 15%. Both of these are major points that set the direction for the company.\\n\\nNext, action items. The document lists several. The marketing team needs to finalize the campaign strategy by July 15th, led by Sarah. The product team has to complete the prototype by August 1st, with John as the owner. Then there's the sales team's training schedule by August 10th, handled by Mike. Each of these has a deadline and a responsible person, so I should include those details.\\n\\nMajor topics discussed include the product launch timeline, budget allocation, and potential partnerships. The partnership with TechCorp was mentioned, but it's still under evaluation. I should note that it's pending further analysis.\\n\\nOutcomes and resolutions would be the decisions made and the action items. The main outcome is the approval of the product launch and budget increase. The resolutions are the specific actions each team needs to take.\\n\\nI need to structure this information using markdown with headings and bullet points. Make sure to prioritize the most significant points. The product launch decision is crucial even though it was a brief discussion. The budget increase is also important for marketing. The action items are clear with deadlines and owners, so they should be listed under their respective sections.\\n\\nI should avoid including the unresolved debate about the partnership since it's still pending. The summary should be objective, sticking to what was decided and the next steps. Let me check if there's any other information that's critical. The meeting minutes also mention a review meeting in September, which is an important follow-up. That should be included under action items or outcomes.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the summary should have sections for key decisions, action items, major topics, and outcomes. Each section should be clear and concise. Let me make sure the deadlines and responsible parties are correctly noted.
